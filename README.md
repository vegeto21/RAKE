It is an algorithm that is used for extracting keywords.it is based on observation that keywords generally contain multiple words,but they seldom involve punctuation marks or stopword such as word and,the,of,or,etc and other word with minimal lexical meaning.
            
            
                different types of weighting
              1.freq
              2.degree.
              3.deg/freq
